In this project, we utilize four types of sensors including temperature, humidity, CO2, and particulate matter to detect fires by employing the DS-Evidence algorithm as presented in our report.
Algorithms and results as well as implementations have been presented in the report.
Thank you Mr. Han Huy Dung and SPARC lab for helping us successfully carry out this project.
